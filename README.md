Inspired by rewatching Metallica’s “Some Kind of Monster”, I decided to take a break from football data and focus on music. In my latest article on Watch 22, I take a look at the Spotify API’s audio features through Metallica’s studio discography. Going through album and song data, I analyse the underlying numbers behind their classic early albums and later, more controversial, albums and attempt to come up with an index that conveys what makes a song “heavy”.
